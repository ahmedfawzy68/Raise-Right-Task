                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2023, Raise Right was born from a simple observation: traditional fundraising methods
                    often fell short of reaching their full potential. Too many deserving causes struggled to find
                    support, while generous people wanted better ways to contribute meaningfully.</p>
                <p>Our founders, a team of technology enthusiasts and social impact advocates, came together to bridge
                    this gap. We've built a platform that prioritizes user experience, campaign success, and most
                    importantly, real-world impact.</p>
                <p>Today, we're proud to have facilitated thousands of successful campaigns, connecting millions of
                    dollars in donations to causes that truly matter.</p>
